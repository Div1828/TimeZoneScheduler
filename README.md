# TimeZoneScheduler

This repository is regarding the solution for DebugIt 2025 competition.
I am Divyanshu Singh, a first year student at IIT-BHU.
The theme i have chosen is "Future of work and remote collaborations".

We are well aware that with the increase in remote jobs, there is an equivalent increase in the problems faced by the employees. One such problem is difficulty in collaborating efficiently with peers or employers. This may occur due to different time zones and a rigorous schedule which the employee needs to keep track of. My website solution allows the user to make a list of his upcoming meetings and choose what city the employer is in and accordingly set the date and time. Then the time will automatically be converted according to the time zone of the city where the employee resides. There are several more features which are listed below:-

1. Easy time zone conversion for various cities
2. Scheduling meetings and sorting them in temporal order
3. Accesing the meetings directly from the website by adding the link of the web meeting while scheduling it
4. Deleting any mis-scheduled meetings


The project includes html, css, javascript and uses their built-in features.
